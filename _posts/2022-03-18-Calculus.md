Summary: Introduction to limits</br>
</br>
Possible limit behaviors</br>
There are many possible limit behaviors.</br>
• The right-hand and left-hand limits may both exist and be equal.</br>
• The right-hand and left-hand limits may both exist, but may fail to be equal. </br>
• A right- and/or left-hand limit could fail to exist due to blowing up to ±1. </br>
(Example: Consider the function 1=x near x = 0.) In this case, we either
say the limit blows up to infinity. We also say that the limit does not exist
because 1 is not a real number! </br>
• A right- and/or left-hand limit could fail to exist because it oscillates between
many values and never settles down. In this case we say the limit does not
exist.</br>
