I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about calculus. It is one of the most important topics for studying Data Science. 
It is a very interesting topic and love it.
Currently I am revising it through Calculus 1A course offered by MITx in edX.
It involves limits, continuity, derivatives and integrals.
